# An Analysis of Kickstart Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis is to provide decision making material to Louise to support her in making strategic decisions. The analysis provides direction for crowdfunding projects that Louise is interested in pursuing. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### Based on the outcomes verse launch date, it is recommended to launch a campaign in May or June. This timing comes with minimal increased risk of failure, but significant increase in having a successful outcome. It is recommended to NOT launch a campaign during the months of October, November, or December. During these months the chance of success is decreasing to the point where in December the probability of failure almost matches that of success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
### Two conclusions that can be drawn from reviewing outcomes verse launch date are that launches in early summer, May and June, are result in more successful outcomes than other times of year and end of year is the worst time to launch. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
### There is a very clear limitation for a succesful campaign when a campaign goal hits $25,000, beyond that, the probability of success rises for campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $45,000 before significantly falling off again.  The most significant chance for success comes with lower goal amounts.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
### As is true with any dataset, there are limitations with the given dataset.  An initial limitation is missing data for how the campaign was targeted and marketed. This type of data may have been useful to understand if there may be a more successful target market by comparing with campaign types, goals, and maybe even locations. For example, campaign success could be driven by cultural norms and interests. 
### An additional piece of data that I would have been interested in seeing for further analysis would be intended launch date of the entertainment to gain understanding on how campaign run dates verse intended launch dates to visualize if there is correlation that can be extracted. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
### Another table or graph that could be helpful would be length of campaing verse outcomes. This would guide decisions on if short or longer campaigns had impact on outcomes. This specific information may be helpful to see in a pivot table in order to be able to filter by category or subcategory to further discuss how length of campaign with a successful outcome may change depending on those variables. 
### If the limitation of entertainment launch date was resolved, it may also be helpful to graph the launch of the entertainment verse success to visualize if that played a role in campaign success and investigate if this played a different role than campaign amounts.
